The BulletEmitter is a tool I've developed for Unity to simplify the process of creating complex bullet patterns for games. 
With this tool, developers can easily design and visualize intricate bullet patterns, leading to more dynamic and engaging gameplay experiences.

I personally use this tool in my game, FirstStrike - Firestrom.
